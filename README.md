# OCEliteBook850G3
OpenCore EFI folder for the HP EliteBook 850 G3

Clone and copy to your EFI folder. Don't forget to add your own [SMBIOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/smbios-support.html#macbook-pro). (ProperTree is advised)
I used SMBIOS of MacBookPro13,3, however; I would advice using MacBookPro13,1 or MacBookPro13,2 since they are using Skylake U processors.
```
git clone https://github.com/lucasrequile/OCEliteBook850G3
```
Everything is working as far as I'm aware, including native Intel Bluetooth and WiFi support.
